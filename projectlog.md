# Project Log — 2025-08-24

This log summarizes the work completed today to improve the keyboard workflow and add an SBI in-page quick search experience.

## Goals
- On the SBI page, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P should open an SBI quick-search pop-up (no redirect).
- Search should use the fully loaded SBI GitHub repos dataset (the repos shown on the SBI page), tolerant of hyphens vs. spaces.
- Selecting a result should highlight the corresponding row with a red box.
- On the All Plugins page, the combo should continue to open PQS (no conflicts).
- Keep the pop-up styling consistent with PQS’ look-and-feel.

## High-level Outcomes
- Implemented a lightweight SBI Quick Search overlay and wired the keyboard shortcut to open it on the SBI page.
- Preserved PQS behavior on the Plugins screen; our keyboard handler defers to PQS there.
- Added red outline highlight on selection to visually locate the repo row.

## Changes by File

- assets/keyboard-shortcuts.js
  - On SBI page, the key combo now opens the SBI Quick Search overlay instead of redirecting to Plugins.
  - On the Plugins page, we still defer to PQS (or call PQS.open when available).

- assets/sbi-quick-search.js (new)
  - Implements the SBI Quick Search modal overlay.
  - Builds its dataset from the currently rendered SBI table rows (repo name + description).
  - Hyphen/underscore/space-tolerant matching by normalizing tokens.
  - Simple ranking (name startsWith > name contains > description tokens > compact match).
  - Keyboard navigation (↑/↓), Enter to select and highlight row, ESC to close.
  - Injects small, PQS-like modal styles inline to avoid additional CSS files.

- src/Admin/AdminInterface.php
  - Enqueues the new sbi-quick-search.js on the SBI screen (after admin.js).

- assets/admin.js
  - Added window.kissSbiFocusRowRed(key) helper to scroll into view and apply a red highlight class.
  - Kept existing window.kissSbiFocusRowByKey for blue highlight (for integrations).

- assets/admin.css
  - Added .kiss-sbi-red-highlight class and a subtle flash animation for the red outline.

## Behavior Notes
- SBI page: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P now opens the SBI search pop-up. Typing filters repos; Enter highlights the chosen row in red and focuses its checkbox.
- Plugins page: PQS keeps handling the combo. No bounce or redirect changes were introduced here.

## How to Verify
1. Open WP Admin → Plugins → KISS Smart Batch Installer.
2. Hard refresh the page once to ensure new JS/CSS loads.
3. Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → the SBI Quick Search modal should appear.
4. Type a repo name using spaces instead of hyphens (e.g., "Plugin Quick Search"). It should match "KISS-Plugin-Quick-Search".
5. Press Enter → the corresponding row should scroll into view with a red outline; the row checkbox receives focus.
6. Press ESC → the modal closes.
7. Go to the All Plugins page and press the combo → PQS opens as before.

## Limitations / Next Steps
- Current search indexes only the repos shown on the current SBI page (due to pagination). If desired, we can expand it to fetch additional pages (via the existing AJAX endpoints) and cache for session-wide search.
- Results list currently shows name + description; we can add badges (Installed/Active) by consuming PQS cache hints or SBI state if needed.
- For strict styling parity with PQS, we can import/share more of PQS’ CSS variables rather than inline minimal styles.
- If we see PQS taking longer to initialize on the Plugins page, consider lengthening our auto-open wait window (separate enhancement).

## Rationale
- Keeping the SBI quick-search entirely on the SBI page eliminates context-switching and aligns with the requested workflow.
- Relying on the already-rendered table keeps implementation simple and performant; normalization covers hyphen/space variance in names.

## Files Added/Modified Today
- Added: assets/sbi-quick-search.js
- Modified: assets/keyboard-shortcuts.js, src/Admin/AdminInterface.php, assets/admin.js, assets/admin.css

## QA Checklist (quick)
- [x] SBI page: hotkey opens overlay
- [x] Hyphen-insensitive matching works
- [x] Enter selects and red-highlights row
- [x] ESC closes
- [x] All Plugins page: PQS still opens
